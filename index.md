Dukes Up!
==================================================

> by Grey and Sam Keenan

"Dukes Up!" is a two-player game
which uses a standard deck of cards.
Inspired by Manipulation Rummy,
players arrange runs/sets on the table
while trying to protect their CASTLES.
Once you learn how to play,
a single game takes about 15 minutes.

Overview
==================================================

Each player has a single card called their "CASTLE".
The goal is to take the opponent's CASTLE by playing it in a run/set.
However, cards called "DUKES" protect the CASTLE and must be taken first.


Setup
==================================================

1. Remove jokers and split the deck by color.
  Give one player all clubs/spades,
  and the other hearts/diamonds. Pick someone to go first.
1. Shuffle your half of the deck
  and set it aside as your draw pile.
  Draw 4 cards.
1. Select 1 of the 4 cards as your CASTLE,
  and place it face-down on the table.
  Select 2 cards as your DUKES,
  and place them face-down in front of the CASTLE.
  The left-over card will be part of your starting hand.
1. Once both players pick their DUKES,
  they say, "Dukes Up!" and flip them face-up in unison.
  The CASTLES remain face-down for now.

Now, the first player can start their turn.
If you play multiple rounds, switch-off who goes first.


Taking Your Turn
==================================================

Start your turn by drawing.
Draw 2 cards at most, making sure your hand doesn't have more than 4 cards.

> * If your hand has 2 cards or less, you may draw 2 cards.
> * If your hand has 3 cards, you can only draw 1 card.
> * If your hand has 4 cards or more, skip drawing.

If your draw pile is empty, reshuffle your discard pile.

**Next, if you have no DUKES, you *must* flip your CASTLE face-up**.
Once up, it can be taken by the opponent.

Now, you can play.
Take any combination of the following actions:

* *Play cards.*
  Create runs/sets using cards from your hand,
  using the opponent's DUKES/CASTLE,
  or by rearranging cards on the table.
  > (See ["Runs, Sets, and Rearranging Cards"](#runs-sets-and-rearranging-cards))
* *Switch DUKES.*
  Exchange the cards serving as your DUKES with cards from your hand.
  [(example)](examples#defending)
  > You cannot switch-out your CASTLE. \
  > You may pick up a DUKE without replacing it,
    but you cannot replace it on a later turn. \
  > You cannot replace DUKES which were taken by the opponent.
* *Protect an open CASTLE.*
  If you have *no* DUKES, create one by placing a card from your hand.

Finally, ensure all cards on the table are in legal runs/sets before discarding.
You *must* discard to end your turn.
Cards are discarded face-down to your own pile.
Choose one of the following:

* Discard a card from your hand.
* Discard a card from your draw pile.
  Do not look at it, and do not look through your discard pile.
* Discard 1 of your-color cards off of the table.
  The remaining cards must be in legal runs/sets.
  [(example)](examples#discarding-off-the-table)

If you didn't play or switch your DUKES, you may discard twice.

Discarding ends the turn.


Runs, Sets, and Rearranging Cards
--------------------------------------------------

In order to play cards, you must form runs and sets.
Runs and sets are played to a shared-table.

* A set is a group of 3+ cards with the same value.
* A run is a group of 3+ cards with sequential values and matching suits.
  In "Dukes Up!",
  **spades/diamonds** go together and **clubs/hearts** go together.

An easy way to remember which suits go together
is to look at the top of the suit symbol.
If it's pointed, it's a "thorn";
if it's rounded, it's a "flower".
Thorns go with thorns, and flowers go with flowers.

> `run of thorns:` A&#9824;, 2&#9824;, 3&#9824;, 4&#9824; \
  `run of thorns:` 8&#9826;, 9&#9826;, 10&#9824; \
  `run of flowers:` 10&#9827;, J&#9827;, Q&#9825;, K&#9825;, A&#9827; \
  `ILLEGAL:` 5&#9827;, 6&#9824;, 7&#9824; \
  `ILLEGAL:` 6&#9825;, 8&#9825;, 9&#9825; \
  `ILLEGAL:` K&#9826;, A&#9826;, 2&#9826;
>
> `set:` 5&#9824;, 5&#9825;, 5&#9826; \
> `ILLEGAL:` 9&#9825;, 9&#9827;

To play cards to the table, arrange them face-up in a run or set.
You may create new combinations or add to existing ones.
Use cards from your hand, *or use the opponent's DUKES*
in order to "take" them.

> Red creates a run of thorns to take Black's 8&#9824; DUKE.


Similarly, if you can use the opponent's face-up CASTLE in a run/set,
you can take it.
This ends the game.
**But**, to take a CASTLE,
you must take any DUKES guarding it in the same turn.

> Red takes Black's J&#9827; CASTLE to end the game.
  Notice that the 3&#9827; DUKE must be taken as well.

Finally, as the above example demonstrates,
you can rearrange existing runs/sets to form new ones.
[(example)](examples#rearranging-cards)
This is *key* to the game's strategy.
However, remember that before you discard,
*all cards on the table must be in legal runs/sets*.


Ending the Game
==================================================

The game ends when someone takes the opponent's CASTLE.
Alternatively, the game ends when
someone has no cards in their draw pile or discard pile.
<!--
The last player may play out their hand before moving on to scoring.
-->

Count up the points!
Take 1 point for each card of your color on the table,
including remaining DUKES and CASTLES.
Whoever took the opponent's CASTLE also gets a 4-point bonus.

The higher score wins.
In a tie, the player who ended the game wins.


Final Rules
==================================================

Once you get a hang it,
there are a couple more rules that keep the game balanced.

* On the first player's first turn,
  in order to switch out a DUKE,
  they must play that DUKE directly to the table in a run/set.
* At the start of your turn,
  you may draw from the discard pile instead of the draw pile.
  When you discard a card from the draw pile,
  place it on the *bottom* of the discard pile.
* You may attempt to use your own CASTLE in a run/set.
  However, if you are unable to end the game in that turn,
  you must return the CASTLE to its position, *face-up*.
  You cannot check the CASTLE during the game.

If you're still confused,
hopefully this will help.
